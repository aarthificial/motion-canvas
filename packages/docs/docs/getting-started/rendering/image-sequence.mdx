# Image sequence

The built-in exporter for Motion Canvas. It stores the rendered frames as a
sequence of images, which can then be imported into a video editor for further
processing.

## Configuration

After selecting the Image sequence exporter in the Video Settings tab, the
following configuration options will become available:

### File Type

The type of image file to which Motion Canvas will convert the frames. Current
options are PNG, JPEG, and WebP. Note that Motion Canvas depends on the
capabilities of your browser to generate image files, and so WebP may not work
on Safari or older browsers.

### Quality

The quality target for compression from 0 to 100, where a lower setting will
result in smaller file sizes but might degrade image quality. A setting of 100
will result in lossless images, such that no detail is lost, but lower settings
will often produce no discernible difference.

### Group by scene

When enabled, each scene will be rendered into a separate image sequence located
in a subdirectory called the same as the scene.

### Export strategy

_Default: `toDataUrl`_<br/> The strategy used to export the frames. Different
strategies may perform better depending on the complexity of your animation and
the browser.

#### Chrome

On Chrome, the `toDataUrl` strategy is the fastest, but it if the animation is
complex enough, the browser may starve the websocket responsible for saving
frames on the disk, causing them to aggregate in memory. You can tell that this
happens if the rendering process goes smoothly at first, until it hits the
[I/O queue limit](#i-o-queue-limit), at which point it will start to freeze and
stutter to let the websocket catch up. If that happens, consider switching to
the `toBlob (Web Worker)` strategy. It will handle the websocket connection in a
dedicated web worker which will not be starved by the main thread. While the
`toBlob` operation is slower on Chrome, the overall performance in this case may
be better.

#### Firefox

On Firefox, we recommend to use the `toBlob` strategy which is the fastest. When
tested on [our example videos](https://github.com/motion-canvas/examples), the
`toBlob` strategy on Firefox was 2-3 times faster than `toDataUrl` on Chrome.
Even if you're using Chrome for development, consider switching to Firefox for
the final export.

### I/O queue limit

_Default: `256`_<br/> The maximum number of frames being sent to the server at
the same time.

The image exporter does not wait for the frame to be stored on the disk before
moving on to the next one. This speeds up the process significantly (See
[pipelining][pipelining]). However, in cases where storing cannot keep up with
rendering, the number of frames queued in memory will grow continuously. This
setting defines a hard limit of queued frames, after which the exporter will
wait for the disk to catch up.

If the rendering process crashes with an "out of memory" error, try decreasing
this value.

The default value (`256`) is the maximum number of simultaneous websocket
connections allowed by most browsers.

### Blob queue limit

_Default: `64`_<br/> The maximum number of `toBlob` operations allowed at the
same time.

Browsers don't limit the number of times `toBlob` can be called, but each new
call slows down the ones already in progress. There exists a tipping point where
the performance starts to degrade. For example, exporting 10 frames, 5 at a time
is faster than exporting them one by one, but exporting all 10 at the same time
may actually be slower. You can use this limit to find what works best for your
animation.
